== Notes ==
Notes should reuse the same wavegen if they are pressed multiple times. Therefore you don't get the same note being played multiple times.
This could be a configurable setting.

Implement Write to all registers that allow all channels to receive commands simultaneously

== Sustain Petal ==
Sustain petal modifies the release of the ADSR. Mostly controlled in software but can have hardware support.
When sustain petal is active, the release can be swapped out for the sustain-decay value. Then swapped back once petal is released.
